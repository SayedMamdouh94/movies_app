## Original Setup Instructions (for reference):

### 1. Create your app icon image:

- Create a PNG image with dimensions: 1024x1024 pixels
- Make sure the icon looks good at small sizes
- Avoid text that's too small to read
- Use appropriate padding around the edges
- Save it as: `assets/images/app_icon.png`

### 2. Convert your existing SVG to PNG:

Since you have `assets/images/app_logo.svg`, you can:

- Open it in a graphics editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma, etc.)
- Export/Save as PNG at 1024x1024 resolution
- Save as `assets/images/app_icon.png`
